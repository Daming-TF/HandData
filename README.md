Introduction: 
The dataset contains 3D vertex coordinates of 50,175 hand meshes aligned with in the wild images comprising hundreds of subjects performing a wide variety of tasks.
The training set was generated from 102 videos resulting in 47,125 hand annotations. The validation and test sets cover 7 videos with an empty intersection of subjects with the training set and contain 1,525 samples each.
The dataset has been collected in a fully automated manner. Please, refer to our paper for the details.
